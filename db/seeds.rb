    content: "Summary
    Background
    Outbreak response efforts for the 2014–15 Ebola virus disease epidemic in west Africa brought widespread transmission to an end. However, subsequent clusters of infection have occurred in the region. An Ebola virus disease cluster in Liberia in November, 2015, that was identified after a 15-year-old boy tested positive for Ebola virus infection in Monrovia, raised the possibility of transmission from a persistently infected individual.
    Methods
    Case investigations were done to ascertain previous contact with cases of Ebola virus disease or infection with Ebola virus. Molecular investigations on blood samples explored a potential linkage between Ebola virus isolated from cases in this November, 2015, cluster and epidemiologically linked cases from the 2014–15 west African outbreak, according to the national case database.
    Findings
    The cluster investigated was the family of the index case (mother, father, three siblings). Ebola virus genomes assembled from two cases in the November, 2015, cluster, and an epidemiologically linked Ebola virus disease case in July, 2014, were phylogenetically related within the LB5 sublineage that circulated in Liberia starting around August, 2014. Partial genomes from two additional individuals, one from each cluster, were also consistent with placement in the LB5 sublineage. Sequencing data indicate infection with a lineage of the virus from a former transmission chain in the country. Based on serology and epidemiological and genomic data, the most plausible scenario is that a female case in the November, 2015, cluster survived Ebola virus disease in 2014, had viral persistence or recurrent disease, and transmitted the virus to three family members a year later.
    Interpretation
    Investigation of the source of infection for the November, 2015, cluster provides evidence of Ebola virus persistence and highlights the risk for outbreaks after interruption of active transmission. These findings underscore the need for focused prevention efforts among survivors and sustained capacity to rapidly detect and respond to new Ebola virus disease cases to prevent recurrence of a widespread outbreak.

    description: "A Year after Initial Infection, a 2015 Flare-Up of Ebola Emphasizes the Need for Continued Surveillance
    The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa led to improved disease surveillance and response capacity in affected countries, which were effective in ending widespread transmission. However, near the end of the epidemic in 2015, several focal clusters of infection were identified. One cluster in Liberia raised the possibility of transmission from a persistently infected female survivor. Investigation of the source of infection for this cluster provides suggestive evidence of Ebola virus disease persistence and highlights the risk for outbreaks after interruption of active transmission.
    
    Evidence of viral persistence among Ebola virus disease survivors underscores the need for risk assessment and focused prevention efforts, as well as sustained capacity to rapidly detect new cases and implement an effective response to prevent a widespread outbreak.",

I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

    And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. You know, I was God once. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
    
    Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. When will that be? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
    
    Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought 'Why should I?' Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

    You're going to do his laundry? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
    
    And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase 'upside your head.'
    
    THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! I'm Santa Claus!
    
    Can we have Bender Burgers again? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I don't want to be rescued.
    
    Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
    
    Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?",
